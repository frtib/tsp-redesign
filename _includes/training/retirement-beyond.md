### [TSP to Retirement and Beyond]({{ site.baseurl }}/agency-service-reps/course-catalog/#tsp-to-retirement-and-beyond){:target="\_blank" .external-link}

This two-part presentation is most relevant for employees within 5-10 years of their planned retirement. The focus is on determining how much someone needs to save in their TSP account so they can retire at their desired standard of living with a nest egg that will last for the rest of their lives.

Part I includes a discussion on estimating future income needs, assessing the impact of long-term risks, deciding when to retire, and prioritizing retirement savings goals.

Part II consists of a discussion of the risks faced by new retirees. We will discuss the concept of a systematic strategy and how it is applied throughout retirement and cover scenarios that illustrate issues participants face during the drawdown process. (4 hours with break)
