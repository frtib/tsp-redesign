### TSP to Retirement and Beyond

This two-part presentation is most relevant for employees planning to retire within 5 to 10 years. The focus is on determining how much someone needs to save in a TSP account in order to retire at an optimal standard of living with a nest egg that will last.

Part I includes a discussion on estimating future income needs, assessing the impact of long-term risks, deciding when to retire, and prioritizing retirement savings goals.

Part II consists of a discussion of the risks that new retirees face. We discuss the concept of a systematic strategy and how to apply it throughout retirement. We cover scenarios that illustrate issues participants face during the drawdown process. This is a 4-hour session with a break.
