  <p>Your most recent Leave and Earnings statement or payslip will show how much you’ve contributed to the TSP this year, usually labeled 'YTD.'

If you have a civilian and a uniformed services TSP account, use the total amount you’ve contributed to both accounts so far this year. Do not include Agency or Service Automatic (1%) or Matching Contributions. If you use this calculator before your

  explanation="
  <p>People often use this calculator to figure out a new dollar amount they should contribute to reach the IRS limit without going over. But when you change how much you’re contributing, it can take 1-2 pay periods for your agency or service to process the new amount. During that time, the TSP will still receive the amount you’re contributing now.</p>
  <p>Enter an estimate of how much you’ll contribute before any changes take effect. If you are uncertain, check with your personnel or finance office.</p>"

  <p>This will depend on how often you are paid (biweekly or monthly, for example). If you are uncertain, check with your personnel or finance office.</p>

  <p>* A biweekly frequency occasionally results in 27 salary payments for a year. Contact your personnel or payroll office if you do not know the number of salary payments you will receive for the remainder of the year.</p>"
