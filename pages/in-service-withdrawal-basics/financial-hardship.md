# Financial hardship

Having the option of taking an in-service withdrawal from your TSP account can be a lifesaver when you’re facing a financial hardship. But before you do, evaluate your options carefully and know the consequences.

- **It's a permanent withdrawal from your TSP account.** You can’t put the money back. Furthermore, it reduces the amount of money that grows and generates compound earnings.

### Tax considerations

- **We’ll withhold 10% on the taxable portion of your withdrawal for federal income tax.** You have the option of increasing or waiving this withholding.
- **The taxable portion of your withdrawal is subject to federal income tax at your ordinary rate.** Also, you may have to pay state income tax.
- **An additional IRS early withdrawal penalty of 10% may apply** if you're under the age of 59½.

### Spousal rights

- **If you’re a FERS employees or a uniformed services member**, a financial hardship withdrawal requires your spouse's notarized consent.
- **If you’re a CSRS employee**, a financial hardship withdrawal requires spouse notification.

## Bankruptcy
The funds in your TSP account are held in trust for you by the TSP and, by law, are protected from the claims of creditors. Your TSP account cannot be garnished to pay debts.

A chapter 7 bankruptcy action does not affect your ability to obtain a financial hardship in-service withdrawal.

Under chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, you are only eligible to receive a financial hardship in-service withdrawal if you have unpaid medical expenses, a casualty loss, or unpaid legal fees incurred for a separation or divorce.

For detailed information about the effect of a bankruptcy on your TSP account, see the TSP fact sheet, [Bankruptcy Information]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs09.pdf).
