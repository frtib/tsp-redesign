# How to invest

We offer a variety of investment options for your retirement. You can choose your own mix of investments from a short-term U.S. Treasury security to index funds made of domestic and international stocks. Or, if you prefer, choose one of our Lifecycle (L) Funds that uses a professionally determined investment mix designed to deliver a balanced approach to investing based on when you'll need your money.
