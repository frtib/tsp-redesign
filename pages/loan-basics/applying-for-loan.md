# Applying for a loan

## Requesting a loan
Before you apply for a TSP loan, please review our booklet, [Loans](#), which is available from your agency or service. You’ll be held accountable for all of the rules and information it contains, so be sure to read it thoroughly.
### Online requests
+ Log in to [My Account](#) to use the wizard to complete Form TSP-20, *Loan Application*. Note: Depending on your marital status, the type of loan you are requesting, and how you want your funds sent to you, you may not be able to complete your loan request online.
+ If you’re unable to complete the loan process online, print out the *Loan Agreement* and mail it to us with any additional required information. We must receive the *Loan Agreement* before the expiration date that appears at the top of the document.

## Spousal rules
By law, your spouse has certain rights to your TSP account. When requesting a loan, you must indicate if you are married, even if you are separated from your spouse.
+ FERS or uniformed services participants: Your spouse must consent to your TSP loan by signing the *Loan Agreement* that you print from this website.
+ CSRS participants: We must notify your spouse when you apply for a loan.
Exceptions to the spousal rule may be approved under very limited circumstances. For more information, please refer to [Form TSP-16](#), _Exception to Spousal Requirements_ ( [TSP-U-16](#), for uniformed services members), which is available from your agency or service.
## Residential loan documentation
When you request a residential loan, you must complete the residential *Loan Agreement* and submit it, along with any required documentation, before your loan can be approved. This form documents the costs associated with the purchase or construction of your primary residence.
#### Documentation requirements

All of your documentation must
+ be from a third party (that is, someone who is selling the home to you or building it for you); and

Your documentation must also show
+ you or your spouse as the purchaser or builder;
+ the purchase or construction price; and
+ the full address of the primary residence.
##### Special requirements
In addition to the requirements listed above, some types of primary residences require you to show further documentation.
##### Cooperative purchase
Purchasing a cooperative requires you to show that you own shares in a cooperative housing corporation.
##### New home construction purchase
Constructing a new primary residence requires you to show evidence that a complete residence will be constructed, such as:
