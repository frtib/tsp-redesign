Thank you for your interest in TSP education.

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) offers a variety of TSP training opportunities. Review the information below to learn which TSP training will be best for you and your employees.

- [TSP webinars and courses](#tspSchedule) – TSP webinars are offered year-round and are open to all federal and uniformed service members. We encourage you to share the TSP webinar calendar with your employees. Advanced registration is required.
- [Benefits specialist and educator training](#specialistTraining) – These sessions cover advanced topics for human resources personnel, service financial specialists, and payroll personnel, and are offered periodically throughout the year. **They are suspended until further notice.**
- [Training for your agency or service](#agencyServiceTraining) – By request, we occasionally conduct trainings and webinars to meet your agency or service’s specific needs. Employees should register for the prescheduled webinars and courses first. If the preset schedule doesn't meet your agency’s or service’s needs, follow the procedures in this section below.

**Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has canceled all in-person TSP training courses and will not be scheduling in-person events until further notice.**

## Who we train
We provide training for all TSP participants and beneficiaries including federal employees under the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS), Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), Foreign Service Pension System (FSPS), Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Service (FSRDS), and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve, Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Commissioned Officer Corps.

## Training costs
We never charge a training fee for live or virtual events. In-person training, when available, is free for those requesting training within 50 miles of the Washington, DC area. For those outside this area, we require the requestor pay the travel expenses and federal per diem for the presenter.

### TSP webinar privacy notice

TSP webinars hosted by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) require participants to complete a registration form via WebEx.

The Federal Employees Retirement System Act (FERSA), codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. Ch. 84, authorizes us to request the information contained on this registration form. Registration is required to participate in the webinar, but your participation in the webinar is voluntary. By submitting this form, you acknowledge that we may record the webinar, including questions and comments from webinar participants. We will use the information you provide to communicate with you and to improve TSP training materials. You may refrain from voicing a question or comment if you do not wish to be recorded.

We will collect and maintain registration information and webinar recordings as part of the FRTIB’s System of Records FRTIB-20 – Communications, Education, and Outreach Materials. The System of Records Notice (SORN) for this system, which describes the system in more depth, is available at [tsp.gov/privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy). We will not share your information with any third parties without your consent unless required by law.
