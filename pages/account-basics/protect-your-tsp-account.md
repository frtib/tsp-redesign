## How to protect your account against fraud

As a TSP participant, you should know how to protect your account against various types of fraud. Private parties offering assistance with your TSP account, including third party mobile apps, have not been approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which is the independent government agency that administers the TSP.

**We WILL NOT do any of the following:**

- Contact you about investment opportunities
- Authorize third parties to provide counseling or investment-related services to you
- Designate or assign the terms “TSP Advisor” or “TSP Counselor” to any individual or group
- Contact you by email except to
  - confirm an account transaction performed on the web, and only if you provided your email address during the transaction; or
  - send you an informational email if you have provided your email address in My Account: Profile Settings. These emails will never ask you for personal information such as your account number, Social Security number, or date of birth.

  If you’re unsure whether correspondence or telephone calls claiming to be from the TSP are authentic, **DO NOT** provide any personal or financial information. [Contact us](/contact/) directly if you have questions or if you need to report any suspicious activity involving your TSP account.

**More way to protect your TSP account:**

- Don’t share your TSP account number, User ID, password, or security question answers.
- Keep your address up to date with your employing agency or service or, if you’re no longer employed there, with us.
- Review TSP correspondence, account statements, and confirmations promptly.
- Log into your TSP account and monitor account activity periodically.
- Contact us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized account activity or errors.
- Only use private and secure networks to log into your TSP account.
- Keep antivirus software up to date on your personal computer and devices.
- Promptly report identity theft to the TSP, the three credit bureaus, and the appropriate government agencies.

**How to block access to your TSP account**

If you find it necessary to block online access to your TSP account, you can do so by going to [My Account: Block Online/ThriftLine Access](javascript:void(0)) or by [calling the ThriftLine](/contact/#contact) and speaking with a Participant Services Representative.

To reinstate online access to your account,  [send a written request](/contact/) and specify which block(s) you want removed (website, ThriftLine, or both). You must sign and date the request, but it does not need to be notarized. You will not be able to make your request online or by calling the ThriftLine.
