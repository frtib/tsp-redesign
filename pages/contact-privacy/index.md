# How to contact us

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires that each Government agency designate a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) who has agency-wide responsibility and accountability for the agency’s privacy program. Acting General Counsel Dharmesh Vashee serves as FRTIB’s SAOP.

If you would like to contact FRTIB’s Privacy Office, or if you would like to submit a privacy complaint, please email us at [privacy@tsp.gov](mailto:privacy@tsp.gov). Please do not send any sensitive information, including Social Security Number, to this email address.

If you have questions about or need assistance with your TSP account, please [contact the Thriftline]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) at 1-877-968-3778 or use the [Message Center]({{ site.message_center}}) through My Account.

Additionally, we have developed instructions for submitting a [Privacy Act request]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact-privacy/submit-privacy-act-request/) if you wish to access or correct records that FRTIB maintains about you.
