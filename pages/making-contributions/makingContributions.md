## How do I start, change, and stop contributions?

Check with your agency’s or service’s payroll office on how to start, change, or stop your TSP contributions. You may be instructed to use your agency's or service's electronic payroll or benefits system (e.g., Employee Express, myPay, LiteBlue, EBIS, or NFC-EPP).

If your agency or service accepts a paper form, you can download and complete the [TSP-1](#), _Election Form_ ([TSP-U-1](#) for uniformed services members), use the form, or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to have it sent to you.

## What’s the difference between making Traditional vs. Roth Contributions?

You can choose between two tax treatments for your TSP contributions:

With Roth TSP contributions, you pay the taxes up front, so during retirement, you will receive qualified Roth distributions tax-free.

Traditional TSP contributions are made before taxes are taken out, which means you will pay taxes when you withdraw the money.

To help you decide which contributions are right for you, check out our videos, “Is Roth TSP Right For Me?” for [civilian](https://youtu.be/m15Cr8WAxhc){:target="\_blank"} and [uniformed services](https://youtu.be/HGz9YdnI3f0){:target="\_blank"} at [youtube.com/tsp4gov](https://youtube.com/tsp4gov){:target="\_blank"}.  You also may want to try our [contribution comparison calculator](https://www.tsp.gov/PlanningTools/Calculators/contributionComparison.html).

## What are the different types of contributions?

### Regular Employee Contributions

Each pay period, your agency or service will deduct your contribution from your basic pay in the amount or percentage that you indicated when you submitted your contribution election information.

Your agency or service will continue to deduct your contribution until you do the following:

* Make a new election changing the amount.
* Elect to stop your contributions.
* Reach the IRS contribution limit.
* Take a financial hardship withdrawal.

For more information, visit [Contribution Limits](https://www.tsp.gov/PlanParticipation/EligibilityAndContributions/contributionLimits.html){:target="\_blank"}.

### Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS employee, your agency or service will contribute an amount equal to 1% of your basic pay each pay date to your TSP account. These are called Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and you don’t need to make employee contributions to receive them.
Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are not taken out of your pay and they do not reduce your pay for income tax purposes.

A Few Words about Vesting

Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are subject to vesting rules. You are vested in (entitled to keep) all of your Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, as well as any earnings that they accrue after a certain period of federal service.

Most FERS participants are vested in automatic contributions after completing 3 years of service. BRS members and FERS employees in congressional and certain non-career positions become vested after 2 years of service.

If you leave federal service before satisfying the vesting requirement, the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and their earnings will be forfeited to the TSP. If you die before separating from service, you are automatically considered vested in all the money in your account.

### Agency/Service Matching Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS participant, you will receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions from your agency or service based on your regular employee contributions once you are eligible. Unlike Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, Matching Contributions are not subject to vesting requirements.

As a FERS or BRS participant, you receive matching contributions on the first 5% of pay that you contribute each pay period. As the table below shows, the first 3% of pay that you contribute will be matched dollar-for-dollar; the next 2% will be matched at 50 cents on the dollar. Contributions above 5% of your pay will not be matched. If you stop making regular employee contributions, your matching contributions will also stop.

<!-- table -->

### Catch-up Contributions
Starting in the year you turn 50, you may be eligible to make catch-up contributions to your TSP account on top of your regular employee contributions. There are no matching contributions for catch-up contributions that you contribute.

To be eligible, you must already be contributing an amount that will reach the IRS’ annual elective deferral limit by the end of the year. Catch-up contributions limits can change each year. You can find the most current IRS limits by visiting Contribution Limits.

You can make catch-up contributions using your agency’s or service’s payroll website (e.g., Employee Express, myPay, LiteBlue, EBIS, or NFC-EPP) or by completing Form TSP-1-C, Catch-Up Contribution Election (or TSP-U-1-C for uniformed services) and submitting it to your payroll office. You can download the form here or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to request a copy.

### A Note for Members of the Uniformed Services

If you are a member of the uniformed services:

* You can contribute from 1 to 100 percent of any incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay — as long as you elect to contribute from your basic pay.
* You can elect to contribute from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay, even if you are not currently receiving them. These contributions will be deducted when you start to receive any of these types of pay.
* You cannot contribute from sources such as housing or subsistence allowances.
* If you are receiving tax-exempt (combat zone) pay, your contributions will also be tax-exempt. You may also contribute more of your pay to the TSP during the year.
* Be aware that if you contribute tax-exempt pay, your total contributions from all types of pay must not exceed the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) section 415(c) annual addition limit for the year. This limit does not include catch-up contributions you may make during the year.
* You cannot make catch-up contributions from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay. You are allowed to use tax-exempt pay to make Roth catch-up contributions, but not to make traditional catch-up contributions.

## How much should I contribute?

When contributing to your retirement, make sure you’re not leaving money on the table. By  contributing **at least** 5% of your pay, you’re taking full advantage of thousands of dollars in matching funds from your agency or service over time.

On top of your salary or basic pay, your agency or service will also contribute up to 5% of your pay to your TSP account each paycheck. You only get the full amount if you contribute at least 5%.

<!-- TABLE -->

Like Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, matching contributions are not taken out of your pay. They also do not reduce your pay for income tax purposes. Combined with the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contribution, they can add as much as 5% of basic pay per pay period to your TSP account.


## What are the contribution limits?

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) places limits on the dollar amount of contributions you can make to the TSP. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) calculates them every year and they can change annually. We announce the limits here and the ThriftLine, through various publications, and on our Facebook and Twitter pages.

### Uniformed services members:
* Roth contributions are subject to the elective deferral limit ($18,500 for 2018) even if you make them from tax-exempt pay.
* You will have to elect traditional contributions for any amount over the elective deferral limit in order to contribute tax-exempt pay toward the annual additions limit.
* If you are eligible to make catch-up contributions and you are deployed to a designated combat zone, you will not be able to make any traditional catch-up contributions from your tax-exempt pay. However, you will be able to make Roth catch-up contributions from tax-exempt pay.

### Ready Reserve members:
* If you are contributing to both a uniformed services and a civilian TSP account, the elective deferral and catch-up contribution limits apply to the total amount of tax-deferred employee contributions you make in a calendar year to both accounts.
* If you are called to active duty and make tax-exempt contributions while deployed in a combat zone, the amount of employee and agency contributions to your civilian account as well as the tax-exempt contributions you make to your uniformed services account cannot exceed the annual addition limit.
