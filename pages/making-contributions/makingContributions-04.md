## How much should I contribute?

When contributing to your retirement, make sure you’re not leaving money on the table. By  contributing **at least** 5% of your pay, you’re taking full advantage of thousands of dollars in matching funds from your agency or service over time.

On top of your salary or basic pay, your agency or service will also contribute up to 5% of your pay to your TSP account each paycheck. You only get the full amount if you contribute at least 5%.

<!-- TABLE -->

Like Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, matching contributions are not taken out of your pay. They also do not reduce your pay for income tax purposes. Combined with the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contribution, they can add as much as 5% of basic pay per pay period to your TSP account.
