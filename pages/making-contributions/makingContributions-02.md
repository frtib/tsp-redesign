## What’s the difference between making Traditional vs. Roth Contributions?

You can choose between two tax treatments for your TSP contributions:

With Roth TSP contributions, you pay the taxes up front, so during retirement, you will receive qualified Roth distributions tax-free.

Traditional TSP contributions are made before taxes are taken out, which means you will pay taxes when you withdraw the money.

To help you decide which contributions are right for you, check out our videos, “Is Roth TSP Right For Me?” for [civilian](https://youtu.be/m15Cr8WAxhc){:target="\_blank"} and [uniformed services](https://youtu.be/HGz9YdnI3f0){:target="\_blank"} at [youtube.com/tsp4gov](https://youtube.com/tsp4gov){:target="\_blank"}.
