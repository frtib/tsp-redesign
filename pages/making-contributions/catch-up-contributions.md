<h1><div class="nav-header">Catch-up contributions</div>Latest information</h1>

Updated **January 1, 2021**.

## Changes to catch-up contributions

The process for catch-up contributions is now easier for TSP participants. If you’re turning 50 or older, you’ll no longer need to make separate catch-up elections to your TSP account to contribute toward the catch-up limit.

## Here’s how it will work

- If you’re turning 50 or older and exceed the IRS elective deferral (or annual addition) limit, then your contributions will automatically start counting toward the IRS catch-up limit. **Just add any contributions toward the catch-up limit in the same place as your other TSP [contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).**

- Your election will carry over each year unless you submit a new one. For instructions on changing your contribution amount, see [Start, change, or stop contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).

- If you’re eligible for an agency or service match, contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit will qualify for the match<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup> on up to 5% of your salary.

- You may [start, stop, or change your contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/) at any time. If you choose not to contribute toward the catch-up limit, you should adjust your TSP contributions accordingly.

## Important note for members of the uniformed services

If you are a uniformed services member and enter a combat zone, your contributions toward the catch-up limit must be Roth. (The TSP cannot accept traditional tax-exempt contributions toward the catch-up limit.) You also cannot contribute toward the catch-up limit from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.

If you are contributing to both a civilian and uniformed services account, the limits apply to the total you contribute to both accounts during the year.

1. For Blended Retirement System (BRS) participants: If you have reached the annual addition limit, your contributions toward catch-up will not be matched. (The IRS does not allow participants who have reached the annual addition limit to receive any more matching for the year.)
