# Know your limits

Below are the **2021** IRS limits and additional information to keep you informed. The Elective Deferral and Catch-up limits are unchanged from 2020.

**Select an option and take a look.**

## All ages

This limit applies to the **combined total of traditional and Roth contributions.** For uniformed services members, this does not apply to traditional contributions from combat-zone pay.

Contributing from your pay before taxes allows your money to grow tax-deferred until you withdraw it. If you make Roth (after-tax) contributions, those contributions could be "qualified" and tax free at retirement. Knowing this limit helps you decide how much to put away each year.

Additionally, this limit does not include matching contributions that you receive from your agency or service, so you're actually saving more.

If you're not maxing out your contributions, consider increasing your contribution amount each chance you get to help reach your retirement savings goals. You might be surprised how big of a difference a small increase can make.

## Age 50 and over

At any time beginning in the year you turn 50, you have the opportunity to **make additional contributions above the IRS elective deferral limit.** These &#8220;contributions toward the catch-up limit&#8221; provide a chance to put away extra money for retirement, even if you're not behind.

  Eligible participants no longer need to make two separate elections each year to contribute toward the [catch-up limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-types/). Instead, your contributions will automatically count toward the IRS catch-up limit if you meet the elective deferral or annual addition limit and keep saving.

  If you’re eligible for an agency or service match, contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit will qualify for the match on up to 5% of your salary. Your election will carry over each year unless you submit a new one.

## All Ages

The annual addition limit is the **total amount of all the contributions you make in a calendar year.** This limit is per employer and includes money from all sources: employee contributions (tax-deferred, after-tax, and tax-exempt), Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, and Agency/Service Matching Contributions. It does not include catch-up contributions.

The annual addition limit affects mostly members of the uniformed services who can exceed the annual elective deferral limit. The excess contributions go into the traditional portion of your account from tax-exempt pay earned in a combat zone.
