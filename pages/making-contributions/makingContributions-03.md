## What are the different types of contributions?

### Regular Employee Contributions

Each pay period, your agency or service will deduct your contribution from your basic pay in the amount or percentage that you indicated when you submitted your contribution election information.

Your agency or service will continue to deduct your contribution until you do the following:

* Make a new election changing the amount.
* Elect to stop your contributions.
* Reach the IRS contribution limit.
* Take a financial hardship withdrawal.

### Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS employee, your agency or service will contribute an amount equal to 1% of your basic pay each pay date to your TSP account. These are called Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and you don’t need to make employee contributions to receive them.
Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are not taken out of your pay and they do not reduce your pay for income tax purposes.

A Few Words about Vesting

Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are subject to vesting rules. You are vested in (entitled to keep) all of your Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, as well as any earnings that they accrue after a certain period of federal service.

Most FERS participants are vested in automatic contributions after completing 3 years of service. BRS members and FERS employees in congressional and certain non-career positions become vested after 2 years of service.

If you leave federal service before satisfying the vesting requirement, the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and their earnings will be forfeited to the TSP. If you die before separating from service, you are automatically considered vested in all the money in your account.

### Agency/Service Matching Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS participant, you will receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions from your agency or service based on your regular employee contributions once you are eligible. Unlike Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, Matching Contributions are not subject to vesting requirements.

As a FERS or BRS participant, you receive matching contributions on the first 5% of pay that you contribute each pay period. As the table below shows, the first 3% of pay that you contribute will be matched dollar-for-dollar; the next 2% will be matched at 50 cents on the dollar. Contributions above 5% of your pay will not be matched. If you stop making regular employee contributions, your matching contributions will also stop.

### Catch-up Contributions
Starting in the year you turn 50, you may be eligible to make catch-up contributions to your TSP account on top of your regular employee contributions. There are no matching contributions for catch-up contributions that you contribute.

To be eligible, you must already be contributing an amount that will reach the IRS’ annual elective deferral limit by the end of the year. Catch-up contributions limits can change each year. You can find the most current IRS limits by visiting Contribution Limits.

You can make catch-up contributions using your agency’s or service’s payroll website (e.g., Employee Express, myPay, LiteBlue, EBIS, or NFC-EPP) or by completing Form TSP-1-C, Catch-Up Contribution Election (or TSP-U-1-C for uniformed services) and submitting it to your payroll office. You can download the form here or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to request a copy.

### A Note for Members of the Uniformed Services

If you are a member of the uniformed services:

* You can contribute from 1 to 100 percent of any incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay — as long as you elect to contribute from your basic pay.
* You can elect to contribute from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay, even if you are not currently receiving them. These contributions will be deducted when you start to receive any of these types of pay.
* You cannot contribute from sources such as housing or subsistence allowances.
* If you are receiving tax-exempt (combat zone) pay, your contributions will also be tax-exempt. You may also contribute more of your pay to the TSP during the year.
* Be aware that if you contribute tax-exempt pay, your total contributions from all types of pay must not exceed the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) section 415(c) annual addition limit for the year. This limit does not include catch-up contributions you may make during the year.
* You cannot make catch-up contributions from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay. You are allowed to use tax-exempt pay to make Roth catch-up contributions, but not to make traditional catch-up contributions.
