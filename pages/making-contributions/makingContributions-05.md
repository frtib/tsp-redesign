## What are the contribution limits?

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) places limits on the dollar amount of contributions you can make to the TSP. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) calculates them every year and they can change annually. We announce the limits here and the ThriftLine, through various publications, and on our Facebook and Twitter pages.

### Uniformed services members:
* Roth contributions are subject to the elective deferral limit ($18,500 for 2018) even if you make them from tax-exempt pay.
* You will have to elect traditional contributions for any amount over the elective deferral limit in order to contribute tax-exempt pay toward the annual additions limit.
* If you are eligible to make catch-up contributions and you are deployed to a designated combat zone, you will not be able to make any traditional catch-up contributions from your tax-exempt pay. However, you will be able to make Roth catch-up contributions from tax-exempt pay.

### Ready Reserve members:
* If you are contributing to both a uniformed services and a civilian TSP account, the elective deferral and catch-up contribution limits apply to the total amount of tax-deferred employee contributions you make in a calendar year to both accounts.
* If you are called to active duty and make tax-exempt contributions while deployed in a combat zone, the amount of employee and agency contributions to your civilian account as well as the tax-exempt contributions you make to your uniformed services account cannot exceed the annual addition limit.
