# Buying a house

If you’re planning to buy or build a new **primary home**, you might consider requesting a residential loan. But before you apply, be sure to read the TSP booklet, _[Loans]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspbk04.pdf)_. Keep in mind that a residential loan is not a mortgage, and your loan interest payments are not tax deductible as they might be for a mortgage or home equity loan. Furthermore, you cannot use a residential loan for refinancing or repaying an existing mortgage, for renovations or repairs, for buying out another person's share in your current home, or for the purpose of land only.

## Residential loan documentation

When you request a TSP residential loan, log in to [My Account: TSP Loans]({{ site.loans }}){:target="\_blank"} to start the application process online, then print out and submit the *Loan Agreement* for processing along with any required documentation. Visit [Applying for a loan]({{ site.baseurl }}/loan-basics/applying-for-a-loan) for more information.

### Documentation requirements
Documentation for all residential loans must
+ be from a third party or someone who is selling the home to you or building it for you;
+ be received by us **before** the expiration date at the top of the *Loan Agreement*;
+ show that you or your spouse is the purchaser or that the residence is being built for you;
+ show the full address of the primary residence; **and**
+ show the purchase or construction price.

### Special requirements
In addition to the requirements listed above, some types of primary residences require you to show further documentation.

#### Cooperative purchase
When buying a cooperative, you must show that you own shares in a cooperative housing corporation.
