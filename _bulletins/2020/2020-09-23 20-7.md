On October 1, 2020, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) will increase the automatic enrollment percentage from 3% to 5% of pay for all Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), and Blended Retirement System (BRS) participants who are automatically enrolled in the TSP on or after October 1, 2020, and for BRS participants automatically re-enrolled in the TSP on or after January 1, 2021, per 5 CFR § 1600.34 and 1600.37. The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009 grants the FRTIB the authority for this change. This change will **not** affect the contribution rates in place for FERS and CSRS participants who were automatically enrolled in the TSP prior to October 1, 2020, or BRS participants who were automatically enrolled prior to October 1, 2020, and did not terminate their contributions.

Increasing the default automatic enrollment rate to 5% ensures that the participant receives the full amount of Agency Matching Contributions he or she is entitled to, which, in turn, will improve the participant’s retirement savings outcome.

This bulletin is to notify agency and service payroll offices and HR personnel of this upcoming change so that agencies and services can take appropriate actions to ensure an efficient transition to the 5% automatic enrollment rate. This bulletin supersedes any previous mentions of the prior automatic enrollment percentage in other bulletins.
