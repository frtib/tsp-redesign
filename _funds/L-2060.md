additional_info: |
  The L 2060 Fund is designed for you if your time horizon falls within the 2058 through 2062 range. The asset allocation of this fund is adjusted quarterly, moving to a more conservative mix, gradually approaching that of the L Income Fund. Between quarterly adjustments, the asset allocation of the L 2060 Fund is maintained through daily rebalancing to the fund’s target allocation.

  Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the fund’s historical returns, visit <a href="/fund-performance/share-price-history/">Share price history</a>. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
risks: |
  When you invest in the L Funds, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. Your account is not guaranteed against loss. The L Funds can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.
risk_level: high
rewards: |
  The L Funds simplify fund selection. You choose the fund that is closest to your target date (or, if your target date falls between the target dates that are offered, you can split your account between the two target date funds closest to your time horizon).

  When you invest in the L Funds:

  - You can be sure that your TSP account is broadly diversified.
  - You don't have to remember to adjust your investment mix as your target date approaches - it's done for you.
