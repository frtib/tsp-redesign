**IRS Form 1099-R** &#8212; The TSP has mailed IRS Form 1099-R, _Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc._, to participants who received a withdrawal up to December 29, 2020, and/or a taxable distribution of a loan up to December 31, 2020. Withdrawals processed on December 30 and 31 are taxable income for 2021. If you have not received Form 1099-R by mid-February, you can print a copy from My Account. Corrected Forms 1099-R will be issued late February/early March. If you are expecting a corrected Form 1099-R, you may wish to wait to file your taxes until you receive the form.
