**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; If you received a required minimum distribution (RMD) from your TSP account in 2020, we must report the income and send you a Form 1099-R even if you rolled the money back into your account or into another retirement account under the terms of the <span class="nobr">[CARES Act]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/withdrawals-and-repayments/#favorable-tax-treatment-for-coronavirus-related-withdrawals)</span>. You may have already received the 1099-R. You should not expect a &#8220;corrected&#8221; 1099-R. Remember that not all reported income is taxable income. If you received an RMD that was eligible for rollover in 2020 and you repaid it or rolled it over by the deadline, then itâ€™s not taxable income. Please consult the IRS or a tax adviser for instructions and additional information on tax filing.
