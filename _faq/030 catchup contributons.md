Starting in the year you turn 50, you become eligible to save even more by contributing toward the [catch-up limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-limits/).

Here’s what you should know:

- Once you exceed the elective deferral or annual addition limit, your contributions will spill over and automatically start counting toward the catch-up limit.
- Contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit are eligible for matching on the first 5% of salary.
- Separate catch-up elections are no longer required. Your election will carry over each year unless you submit a new election or leave federal service.
- You may start, stop, or change your contributions at any time.

If you are a uniformed services member and enter a combat zone, your contributions toward the catch-up limit must be Roth. (The TSP cannot accept traditional tax-exempt contributions toward the catch-up limit.) You also cannot contribute toward the catch-up limit from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.

If you are contributing to both a civilian and uniformed services account, the limits apply to the **total** you contribute to both accounts during the year.

To contribute toward the catch-up limit, use [Form TSP-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1.pdf/), _Election Form_ (or [Form TSP-U-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf/) for uniformed services), or your agency’s or service’s electronic system (e,g., [Employee Express]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=7){:rel="nofollow"}, EBIS, [LiteBlue]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=8){:rel="nofollow"}, [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"}, or [NFC Employee Personal Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=9){:rel="nofollow"}). You can add any contributions toward the catch-up limit in the same place as your other TSP contributions. Remember, separate catch-up elections are not required.
